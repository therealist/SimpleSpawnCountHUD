# SimpleSpawnCountHUD

Shows number of spawn points on a map in upper-left corner, in three categories: Hunters, Props, Both. Also shows map name as generated by .bsp file.

Recommended for development and test use on single-player local server only, as this does not have any system of toggling on/off.
